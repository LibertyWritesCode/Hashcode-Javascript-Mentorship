# Hashcode-Javascript-Mentorship

I started this mentorship in February 2023. I'll be keeping track of my progress here and will upload solved questions as I go.

## Index.Js is Assignment 1
I wrote a javascript code to calculate cgpa of students in a school using logical operator && and relational operators <= and >=

## How did I solve Assignment 2?

### I solved some Hackerrank questions
I'd have to import the solved questions on hackerrank to github
